My name is Logan Icard and I am a senior here at Kennesaw State University with a degree in Computer Science. I have taken classes in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, and Information Retrieval to go along with the standard curriculum 
to go along with normal curriculum for Computer Science. In completing these classes, I have become proficient in Java and Python, as well as familiar with Dart, C#, and R. I have limited experience with creating UI and more experience 
creating the back-end systems for assignemnts in class, but I have enjoyed the time I have gotten to spend on it.
